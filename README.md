Introduction:


More and more individual teachers and small teaching institutions are rising up lately.

Other than focusing on teaching and promoting, they also have to spend time on arranging the classes, informing the classes to their students and collecting tuitions and even pay salaries to employees. 

All these works draw a lot of their attention and keep them away from the important things.

THUS, we build this website to help those individuals and small start-ups manage their business easier.

With this website, one can easily manage classes, teachers, students, classrooms, income, outcome and perhaps more.
