0.59||||From marketing tricks to shady practices,  
2.94||||the food industry has a lot of secrets.  
5.49||||But they just want you to think about their yummy products, nothing else.  
8.92||||Well, it's important to know about the things you eat.  
11.17||||Whether you love eating meat, or choose not to, isn't really the question.  
14.97||||Here are some crucial facts you should know about the food you eat.  
20.548||||- Amazing!  
22.46||||Number 10. A lot of antibiotics go into meat.  
26.29||||Did you know that 80% of the antibiotics produced in the world are fed to animals?  
30.9||||Most of them don't actually go to human beings!  
33.42||||That's what a study in 2011 revealed. Now, you might think that's not all that bad.  
38.18||||It probably makes your meat safe and healthy, right?  
40.55||||Well, unfortunately, that's not the full story.  
43.52||||The actual reason is that antibiotics help generate rapid growth artificially,  
47.95||||which makes sure that the livestock is as big as they can be.  
51.09||||Unfortunately, this can have harmful consequences for the world.  
54.73||||That's because the overuse of antibiotics is really dangerous.  
58.43||||It can help the rise of super bacterias,  
60.63||||which are resistant to antibiotics. And that's not good for anyone, cattle or people.  
65.93||||Number nine, Food Companies Are Hiding Sugar.  
68.79||||Nowadays, it's pretty much common knowledge that you should avoid sugar as much as possible.  
73.03||||It's bad for your teeth, it contains no essential nutrients,  
76.24||||it can help you develop diabetes and all sort of other problems.  
79.45||||If you want to live a healthy life, you know it's all about consuming it in moderation.  
83.93||||To put it in perspective, we actually eat in just eight days the same amount of sugar people from the 1700s  
90.15||||ate over an entire year. Surely that's not a good thing.  
93.66||||Well, food companies don't want you  to stop buying their products because they have  too much sugar.  
97.7||||So, they devised a sneaky little solution.  
100.15||||Some companies hide the true amount of sugar  inside of a product by mixing up different ingredients.   
104.95||||How so?  Well, here are some of the label names you'll see used  instead of sugar.   
109.52||||High-fructose corn syrup, cane crystals,   
112.1||||dextrose, evaporated cane juice,   
114.59||||agave nectar or fruit juice concentrate.  
117.26||||All of these are basically sugar, just with different names. This way, companies makes sure that sugar doesn't appear  
122.77||||at the top of the ingredients list on the back of the box.  
125.76||||So, most people don't actually realize how much actual sugar they're actually consuming.  
130.15||||Next time you're in the supermarket,  
131.65||||try checking the ingredients list and see how many of these you can spot in the wild!  
135.72||||Number Eight, Monsanto's Secrets Of all the food corporations out there,  
140.71||||Monsanto sometimes feels like they're gunning for the title of the worst.  
144.87||||The list of things they probably wish to keep hidden is pretty extensive.  
148.59||||Monsanto was one of the first companies to genetically modify a plant cell, in 1983.  
154.0||||It started producing genetically modified crops  
156.47||||that were resistant to their own herbicide, called Round-Up.  
159.74||||These seeds were marketed as a safer  and healthier alternative to other competitors.  
164.62||||With that, Monsanto took over the market.  
167.49||||Most farmers now use Monsanto's products.  
170.15||||The seeds that they sell, however,  
171.94||||contain a Monsanto-owned patent in their genes.  
175.0||||So only Monsanto can say who gets to plant their seeds or who doesn't.  
178.91||||Not all farmers went with these new crops, however.  
181.51||||Some decided to stay with their old seeds.  
183.81||||There's one problem, though.  
185.31||||Monsanto has actually sued many farmers,  
188.02||||accusing them of having used their GMO-seeds without permission.  
191.5||||In virtually all the cases, however,  
193.49||||those farmers didn't use the seeds willingly.  
196.15||||Unwanted seeds actually flew into their crops,  
198.83||||from neighbors farms who used Monsanto's seeds.   
201.79||||Worst of all, these seeds would actually destroy the organic farmer's crop.  
206.13||||So, many farmers had their crops destroyed  
208.91||||and then were driven to bankruptcy  
210.67||||by having to defend themselves in court.  
212.88||||That's not all!  
213.96||||Another little secret Monsanto wants to keep hidden?  
216.88||||They aren't a big fan of bees.  
218.88||||Because these genetically modified crops have been created  
221.58||||to self-pollinate, they don't need bees to do that for them. In fact, many speculate that bees  
226.99||||are actually getting in the company's way  
228.93||||because they're a way to break their monopoly by naturally creating foods outside of the company's patent.  
233.98||||However, when bees try to pollinate a GM flower or plant,  
237.47||||it gets poisoned and dies,  
239.39||||mostly because of Monsanto's pesticide roundup  
241.9||||which is used in conjunction with their GM crops. Monsanto, of course, denies all this.  
247.07||||But, with their track record, can you really believe them?  
249.94||||Number seven, Your Shrimps Are Dirty, in a lot of ways.  
253.68||||Did you know that most of the shrimps sold worldwide are imported from countries like Thailand or Indonesia?  
259.3||||They're grown in a type of farm. Which are actually crowded and filthy pools,  
263.5||||full of antibiotics, disinfectants, and pesticides.  
267.58||||Most pesticides used, in fact, are actually banned  
270.18||||in places like the US. These pools are so dense and dirty that many shrimps actually die in it.  
276.22||||Not only that, many prawn farms slice open  
279.12||||and cut off the eyes of female shrimps  
280.89||||to make them breed faster as it causes them to develop mature ovaries.  
285.13||||This practice, called eyestalk ablation  
287.45||||happens in almost all prawn hatcheries around the world.  
290.55||||It has been reported that the eyestalks fully regenerate after a few months,  
294.35||||but scientists agree that this they do  
295.93||||show traumatized reactions when this treatment is performed.  
299.21||||That's not all the problems with shrimp farms, however.  
301.79||||This type of farmed shrimp also causes harm to the environment.  
305.13||||Plus, many of these productions actually use slave labor.  
308.83||||Next time you're feeling hungry for some shrimp,  
311.12||||maybe first check where it comes from.  
313.11||||Number six, Many Cheese Products Aren't Cheese  
316.82||||Who doesn't love cheese?  
318.1||||It's delicious and it goes on pretty much everything.  
320.54||||But, if you look closely, the cheese you're eating  
323.16||||might not actually be cheese. It's all on the label.  
326.14||||If a product is labeled as a cheese product,  
328.6||||that's because it isn't real cheese.  
330.72||||Large-scale dairy producers actually replace milk with processed milk concentrate or whey protein concentrate in many of their products.  
338.33||||Why, to save money, of course.  
340.72||||However, as a result, you can't actually call the end product cheese.  
345.0||||Hence the term, cheese product.  
347.18||||Some examples of cheese products include,  
349.77||||processed sliced cheese, cheese sticks  
352.41||||and some shredded cheese brands. That doesn't happen just with cheese, though.  
356.87||||While many products claim to be one thing  
358.77||||on the front of their boxes,  
360.41||||that's often just a marketing name. The legal name usually appears in smaller print,  
365.33||||somewhere else on the box.  
367.2||||If you want to always be sure of what you're eating,  
369.65||||always read the back of the box.  
371.77||||Number five, Pregnant Pigs Are Confined To Tiny Crates.  
375.63||||Pregnant pigs don't get preferential treatment, unfortunately.  
379.17||||Millions and millions of pregnant pigs are actually kept  
381.97||||in very small cages, usually called gestation crates.  
385.66||||These crates are so small that the pigs can't even turn around.  
389.6||||They also have slatted concrete floors. Why is that, you ask?  
393.57||||So that all the waste that the pigs eject  
395.63||||just slides down to pits that are underneath them.  
398.07||||They spend four months inside these crates,  
400.49||||their full pregnancy.  
402.05||||At the end of it, these pigs usually suffer from ulcers, abscesses and sores.  
407.23||||It's such harsh living conditions that many countries  
409.82||||have actually banned this practice, like the UK and Sweden.  
413.28||||Number four, They're Selling You Fake Fiber.  
416.31||||Nowadays, many doctors and experts extol the virtues of including fiber in your diet.  
421.38||||They say it's great for your digestive system and overall health.  
424.85||||But really, food companies just saw an opportunity  
427.56||||to make people buy more products by jumping on the fiber bandwagon.  
431.43||||Some basically skipped the whole actually putting fiber in their products thing.  
435.17||||In many cases, the products that are labeled as high in fiber are actually misleading you.  
440.17||||Those products are filled with fake fiber-synthetic products.  
443.52||||You can technically, and more importantly,  
445.55||||legally call them fiber. But they are far from the fiber that will make you healthier.  
450.1||||Quite the contrary, this fake fiber can cause bloating, gas and general gastrointestinal distress.  
456.54||||Once again, it's always important to watch out for shoddy marketing while in the supermarket.  
460.0||||Number three, cows are now fed corn.  
464.27||||And that's not a good thing.  
466.17||||It's entirely unnatural for cows to eat corn.  
469.06||||They have evolved over thousands of years  
471.14||||on a diet that consisted of eating grass.  
473.72||||The process of digesting corn is unnatural to them.  
476.67||||If not done correctly, it can kill the animal.  
479.48||||Especially if they aren't being fed a lot of antibiotics along with the corn.  
483.68||||That's not all of it, though.  
485.17||||There's a whole E.coli problem associated with this. For those who don't remember, E.coli is a bacteria that can,  
491.67||||in some cases, be deadly. Well, cows actually produce a lot more of E.coli  
496.09||||in their gut when they're fed corn.  
498.07||||This is poses a huge risk in terms of contamination  
501.01||||of the meat we eat.  
502.34||||How do they handle this problem, you ask?  
504.34||||To combat this, they often treat beef with ammonia,  
507.53||||to try and kill the bacteria.  
509.42||||Yes, the same ammonia that can be found in floor cleaners.  
512.96||||It might be in your ground beef.  
514.89||||It can also comprise of up to 15% of fast-food burgers.  
518.61||||And it's all completely legal!  
520.99||||On top of all of this, there's still something to be said  
523.84||||for the treatment of cows, who don't live a very great life before going to the slaughterhouse.  
528.99||||They live in stressful conditions,  
530.96||||produce way more milk than they naturally would in the wild and some veals are even saddled  
536.24||||with heavy chains for their entire lives.  
538.82||||Overall, it seems that cows have a pretty rough life. Number two, Male Chicks Are GroundUp Alive  
545.85||||Companies in the egg industry don't have a use for male chicks.  
549.33||||After all, they can't lay eggs. They aren't used for reproduction, plus,  
553.79||||they can't be bred for meat, for example,  
555.91||||because egg-laying chickens are different from the type used for meat.  
559.58||||That's why, as soon as they hatch,  
561.58||||male chicks are sent directly into the grinder. Another shameful little secret from the poultry industry  
567.5||||is that the label free range doesn't really mean much when applied to chickens.  
571.66||||When we talk about free range,  
573.47||||most people might picture happy chickens roaming  
575.83||||around beautiful green pastures, living freely. That's only really accurate for organic chickens,  
581.67||||but they only equate to around 3% of all produced.  
584.99||||In reality, so-called free-range chickens are still raised in giant, overcrowded sheds.  
591.26||||Free-range chickens get access to the outdoors,  
594.13||||but since there are no limits on flock size,  
596.56||||many are still so cramped together  
598.34||||they can't even spread their wings. They also live in filthy conditions,  
602.55||||with manure-laden flooring that's only cleaned every  
605.07||||two or four years. Number one, Chickens Have Really Changed  
609.34||||We've actually been shaping the way chickens grow  
611.73||||and look like for quite some time.  
613.76||||This is so companies can make as much meat,  
616.1||||and hence profit, as possible. Intensive breeding turned these animals  
619.67||||into what we could call super breeds,  
622.01||||made to grow faster and produce more meat.  
624.97||||We selectively bred them to accentuate preferable traits.  
628.36||||For example, most people like white meat.  
631.04||||So chicken breasts increased significantly over the years.  
634.52||||The breasts of a modern meat chicken,  
636.49||||also called a broiler chicken,  
638.23||||is 80 percent larger than of chickens from 60 years ago.  
641.78||||Wild chickens of old actually looked more like pheasants  
644.33||||than the massive ones we have today.  
646.1||||Take a chicken from 1925, for example. It usually weighed around 1.2 kilos  
651.35||||before it was slaughtered at the age of 112 days old.  
654.61||||Nowadays they weigh around 2.6 kilos,  
657.07||||and are slaughtered after only 47 days. That's because we control all aspects of their lives.  
663.16||||They live a strictly-regimented life,  
665.22||||in controlled and confined environments.  
667.7||||Chickens are usually raised in close quarters so that they don't waste energy.  
671.65||||That makes them grow faster and get bigger  
673.87||||in a shorter period of time.  
675.77||||But those conditions are also very stressful.  
678.7||||That's the reason most farmers elect to clip  
680.83||||or burn the beaks from their chickens. This is done to prevent the chickens  
684.38||||from pecking each other to death.  
686.04||||All of this can show a side to farming that might  
688.41||||not be pretty to look at, but is important to know.  
691.03||||No matter if your next lunch will be a good chicken sandwich or a tasty salad.  
695.21||||Did something on this list really shock you?  
697.6||||Are there more secrets you would like people to know?  
700.11||||Share your thoughts with me in the comments down below!  
702.67||||Thanks for watching.
