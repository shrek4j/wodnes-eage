0.59||||From marketing tricks to shady practices,
2.94||||the food industry has a lot of secrets.
5.49||||But they just want you to think
6.7||||about their yummy products, nothing else.
8.92||||Well, it's important to know about the things you eat.
11.17||||Whether you love eating meat,
12.34||||or choose not to, isn't really the question.
14.97||||Here are some crucial facts
16.37||||you should know about the food you eat.
20.548||||- Amazing!
22.46||||Number 10. A lot of antibiotics go into meat.
26.29||||Did you know that 80% of the antibiotics
28.61||||produced in the world are fed to animals?
30.9||||Most of them don't actually go to human beings!
33.42||||That's what a study in 2011 revealed. Now, you might think that's not all that bad.
38.18||||It probably makes your meat safe and healthy, right?
40.55||||Well, unfortunately,that's not the full story.
43.52||||The actual reason is that antibiotics
45.7||||help generate rapid growth artificially,
47.95||||which makes sure that the livestock is as big as they can be.
51.09||||Unfortunately, this canhave harmful consequences for the world.
54.73||||That's because the overuse of antibiotics
56.85||||is really dangerous.
58.43||||It can help the rise of super bacterias,
60.63||||which are resistant to antibiotics.And that's not good for anyone, cattle or people.
65.93||||Number nine, Food Companies Are Hiding Sugar
68.79||||Nowadays, it's pretty much common knowledge that you should avoid sugar as much as possible.
73.03||||It's bad for your teeth, it contains no essential nutrients,
76.24||||it can help you develop diabetes and all sort
78.49||||of other problems.
79.45||||If you want to live a healthy life, you know it's all about
82.04||||consuming it in moderation.
83.93||||To put it in perspective, we actually eat in just eight days the same amount of sugar people from the 1700s
90.15||||ate over an entire year.Surely that's not a good thing.
93.66||||Well, food companies don't want you
95.03||||to stop buying their products because they have
96.72||||too much sugar.
97.7||||So, they devised a sneaky little solution.
100.15||||Some companies hide the true amount of sugar inside of a product by mixing up different ingredients.
104.95||||How so? Well, here are some of the label names you'll see used
108.07||||instead of sugar.
109.52||||High-fructose corn syrup, cane crystals,
112.1||||dextrose, evaporated cane juice,
114.59||||agave nectar or fruit juice concentrate.
117.26||||All of these are basically sugar, just with different names.This way, companies makes sure that sugar doesn't appear
122.77||||at the top of the ingredients list on the back of the box.
125.76||||So, most people don't actually realize how much actual sugar
128.58||||they're actually consuming.
130.15||||Next time you're in the supermarket,
131.65||||try checking the ingredients list and see how many of these you can spot in the wild!
135.72||||Number Eight, Monsanto's Secrets
138.43||||Of all the food corporations out there,
140.71||||Monsanto sometimes feels like they're gunning for the title of the worst.
144.87||||The list of things they probably wish to keep hidden
147.01||||is pretty extensive.
148.59||||Monsanto was one of the first companies
150.73||||to genetically modify a plant cell, in 1983.
154.0||||It started producing genetically modified crops
156.47||||that were resistant to theirown herbicide, called Round-Up.
159.74||||These seeds were marketed as a safer
161.71||||and healthier alternative to other competitors.
164.62||||With that, Monsanto took over the market.
167.49||||Most farmers now use Monsanto's products.
170.15||||The seeds that they sell, however,
171.94||||contain a Monsanto-ownedpatent in their genes.
175.0||||So only Monsanto can say whogets to plant their seeds
177.93||||or who doesn't.
178.91||||Not all farmers went withthese new crops, however.
181.51||||Some decided to stay with their old seeds.
183.81||||There's one problem, though.
185.31||||Monsanto has actually sued many farmers,
188.02||||accusing them of havingused their GMO-seedswithout permission.
191.5||||In virtually all the cases, however,
193.49||||those farmers didn'tuse the seeds willingly.
196.15||||Unwanted seeds actuallyflew into their crops,
198.83||||from neighbors farms whoused Monsanto's seeds.Worst of all, these seedswould actually destroy
204.57||||the organic farmer's crop.
206.13||||So, many farmers had their crops destroyed
208.91||||and then were driven to bankruptcy
210.67||||by having to defend themselves in court.
212.88||||That's not all!
213.96||||Another little secretMonsanto wants to keep hidden?
216.88||||They aren't a big fan of bees.
218.88||||Because these geneticallymodified crops have been created
221.58||||to self-pollinate, they don'tneed bees to do that for them.In fact, many speculate that bees
226.99||||are actually getting in the company's way
228.93||||because they're a wayto break their monopolyby naturally creating foodsoutside of the company's patent.
233.98||||However, when bees try topollinate a GM flower or plant,
237.47||||it gets poisoned and dies,
239.39||||mostly because ofMonsanto's pesticide roundup
241.9||||which is used in conjunctionwith their GM crops.Monsanto, of course, denies all this.
247.07||||But, with their track record,can you really believe them?
249.94||||Number seven, Your ShrimpsAre Dirty, in a lot of ways.
253.68||||Did you know that most ofthe shrimps sold worldwideare imported from countrieslike Thailand or Indonesia?
259.3||||They're grown in a type of farm.Which are actuallycrowded and filthy pools,
263.5||||full of antibiotics,disinfectants, and pesticides.
267.58||||Most pesticides used, infact, are actually banned
270.18||||in places like the US.These pools are so denseand dirty that many shrimps
274.88||||actually die in it.
276.22||||Not only that, many prawn farms slice open
279.12||||and cut off the eyes of female shrimps
280.89||||to make them breedfaster as it causes them
283.15||||to develop mature ovaries.
285.13||||This practice, called eyestalk ablation
287.45||||happens in almost all prawnhatcheries around the world.
290.55||||It has been reported that the eyestalksfully regenerate after a few months,
294.35||||but scientists agree that this they do
295.93||||show traumatized reactions whenthis treatment is performed.
299.21||||That's not all the problemswith shrimp farms, however.
301.79||||This type of farmedshrimp also causes harm
304.13||||to the environment.
305.13||||Plus, many of these productionsactually use slave labor.
308.83||||Next time you're feelinghungry for some shrimp,
311.12||||maybe first check where it comes from.
313.11||||Number six, Many CheeseProducts Aren't Cheese
316.82||||Who doesn't love cheese?
318.1||||It's delicious and it goeson pretty much everything.
320.54||||But, if you look closely,the cheese you're eating
323.16||||might not actually be cheese.It's all on the label.
326.14||||If a product is labeledas a cheese product,
328.6||||that's because it isn't real cheese.
330.72||||Large-scale dairy producersactually replace milkwith processed milk concentrateor whey protein concentrate
336.75||||in many of their products.
338.33||||Why, to save money, of course.
340.72||||However, as a result,you can't actually callthe end product cheese.
345.0||||Hence the term, cheese product.
347.18||||Some examples of cheese products include,
349.77||||processed sliced cheese, cheese sticks
352.41||||and some shredded cheese brands.That doesn't happen justwith cheese, though.
356.87||||While many products claim to be one thing
358.77||||on the front of their boxes,
360.41||||that's often just a marketing name.The legal name usuallyappears in smaller print,
365.33||||somewhere else on the box.
367.2||||If you want to always besure of what you're eating,
369.65||||always read the back of the box.
371.77||||Number five, Pregnant PigsAre Confined To Tiny Crates
375.63||||Pregnant pigs don't get
377.06||||preferential treatment, unfortunately.
379.17||||Millions and millions ofpregnant pigs are actually kept
381.97||||in very small cages, usuallycalled gestation crates.
385.66||||These crates are so small that the pigs
388.11||||can't even turn around.
389.6||||They also have slatted concrete floors.Why is that, you ask?
393.57||||So that all the waste that the pigs eject
395.63||||just slides down to pitsthat are underneath them.
398.07||||They spend four monthsinside these crates,
400.49||||their full pregnancy.
402.05||||At the end of it, these pigsusually suffer from ulcers,
405.36||||abscesses and sores.
407.23||||It's such harsh livingconditions that many countries
409.82||||have actually banned thispractice, like the UK and Sweden.
413.28||||Number four, They'reSelling You Fake Fiber.
416.31||||Nowadays, many doctors andexperts extol the virtues
419.49||||of including fiber in your diet.
421.38||||They say it's great foryour digestive system
423.54||||and overall health.
424.85||||But really, food companiesjust saw an opportunity
427.56||||to make people buy moreproducts by jumping
429.58||||on the fiber bandwagon.
431.43||||Some basically skipped thewhole actually putting fiber
433.88||||in their products thing.
435.17||||In many cases, theproducts that are labeledas high in fiber areactually misleading you.
440.17||||Those products are filled
441.43||||with fake fiber-synthetic products.
443.52||||You can technically, and more importantly,
445.55||||legally call them fiber.But they are far from the fiber
448.93||||that will make you healthier.
450.1||||Quite the contrary, this fake fiber
452.41||||can cause bloating, gas and general
454.48||||gastrointestinal distress.
456.54||||Once again, it's alwaysimportant to watch out
458.97||||for shoddy marketingwhile in the supermarket.Number three, cows are now fed corn.
464.27||||And that's not a good thing.
466.17||||It's entirely unnaturalfor cows to eat corn.
469.06||||They have evolved over thousands of years
471.14||||on a diet that consisted of eating grass.
473.72||||The process of digestingcorn is unnatural to them.
476.67||||If not done correctly,it can kill the animal.
479.48||||Especially if they aren't being feda lot of antibiotics along with the corn.
483.68||||That's not all of it, though.
485.17||||There's a whole E.coliproblem associated with this.For those who don't remember,E.coli is a bacteria that can,
491.67||||in some cases, be deadly.Well, cows actually producea lot more of E.coli
496.09||||in their gut when they're fed corn.
498.07||||This is poses a huge riskin terms of contamination
501.01||||of the meat we eat.
502.34||||How do they handle this problem, you ask?
504.34||||To combat this, they oftentreat beef with ammonia,
507.53||||to try and kill the bacteria.
509.42||||Yes, the same ammonia that canbe found in floor cleaners.
512.96||||It might be in your ground beef.
514.89||||It can also comprise of upto 15% of fast-food burgers.
518.61||||And it's all completely legal!
520.99||||On top of all of this, there'sstill something to be said
523.84||||for the treatment of cows,who don't live a verygreat life before going
527.53||||to the slaughterhouse.
528.99||||They live in stressful conditions,
530.96||||produce way more milk than they naturally
533.08||||would in the wild and someveals are even saddled
536.24||||with heavy chains for their entire lives.
538.82||||Overall, it seems that cowshave a pretty rough life.Number two, Male Chicks Are GroundUp Alive
545.85||||Companies in the egg industry don't have
547.84||||a use for male chicks.
549.33||||After all, they can't lay eggs.They aren't used for reproduction, plus,
553.79||||they can't be bred for meat, for example,
555.91||||because egg-laying chickens are different
557.94||||from the type used for meat.
559.58||||That's why, as soon as they hatch,
561.58||||male chicks are sentdirectly into the grinder.Another shameful little secretfrom the poultry industry
567.5||||is that the label freerange doesn't really mean
569.81||||much when applied to chickens.
571.66||||When we talk about free range,
573.47||||most people might picturehappy chickens roaming
575.83||||around beautiful greenpastures, living freely.That's only really accuratefor organic chickens,
581.67||||but they only equate toaround 3% of all produced.
584.99||||In reality, so-called free-rangechickens are still raised
588.72||||in giant, overcrowded sheds.
591.26||||Free-range chickens getaccess to the outdoors,
594.13||||but since there are nolimits on flock size,
596.56||||many are still so cramped together
598.34||||they can't even spread their wings.They also live in filthy conditions,
602.55||||with manure-laden flooringthat's only cleaned every
605.07||||two or four years.Number one, Chickens Have Really Changed
609.34||||We've actually been shapingthe way chickens grow
611.73||||and look like for quite some time.
613.76||||This is so companiescan make as much meat,
616.1||||and hence profit, as possible.Intensive breeding turned these animals
619.67||||into what we could call super breeds,
622.01||||made to grow faster and produce more meat.
624.97||||We selectively bred them toaccentuate preferable traits.
628.36||||For example, most people like white meat.
631.04||||So chicken breasts increasedsignificantly over the years.
634.52||||The breasts of a modern meat chicken,
636.49||||also called a broiler chicken,
638.23||||is 80 percent larger than ofchickens from 60 years ago.
641.78||||Wild chickens of old actuallylooked more like pheasants
644.33||||than the massive ones we have today.
646.1||||Take a chicken from 1925, for example.It usually weighed around 1.2 kilos
651.35||||before it was slaughteredat the age of 112 days old.
654.61||||Nowadays they weigh around 2.6 kilos,
657.07||||and are slaughtered after only 47 days.That's because we controlall aspects of their lives.
663.16||||They live a strictly-regimented life,
665.22||||in controlled and confined environments.
667.7||||Chickens are usuallyraised in close quartersso that they don't waste energy.
671.65||||That makes them grow faster and get bigger
673.87||||in a shorter period of time.
675.77||||But those conditionsare also very stressful.
678.7||||That's the reason mostfarmers elect to clip
680.83||||or burn the beaks from their chickens.This is done to prevent the chickens
684.38||||from pecking each other to death.
686.04||||All of this can show aside to farming that might
688.41||||not be pretty to look at,but is important to know.
691.03||||No matter if your next lunchwill be a good chicken sandwich
693.79||||or a tasty salad.
695.21||||Did something on thislist really shock you?
697.6||||Are there more secrets youwould like people to know?
